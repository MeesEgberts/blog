Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern that stores the *state changes* of your system—called “events”—instead of just the current state. Instead of saving a snapshot of “what is,” it saves a sequence of “what happened.” Each event represents a fact that occurred (e.g., *OrderPlaced*, *PaymentReceived*, *UserEmailUpdated*). The current state can always be rebuilt by replaying these events.

For developers used to CRUD-based systems, this approach may sound like extra work. But event sourcing unlocks several benefits:

* **Auditability:** You always know *why* something happened.
* **Debuggability:** You can replay events to reproduce past system states.
* **Integrations:** Other systems can subscribe to meaningful domain events instead of database changes.
* **Scalability:** Writes and reads can evolve independently, often paired with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).

In the NestJS ecosystem, event sourcing fits naturally thanks to its modular architecture, dependency injection, and ability to combine with CQRS through the official `@nestjs/cqrs` package.
